       <p> I am really interested in web design and creative directing and I thought this course would give me a good introduction into the coding and web design world.</p>
       <p>The only experience I have is breifly in digital studio but not any other experience.</p>
       <p>I hope to learn the fundamentals and basics of web production.</p>
       <p>I think there is going to be more technical skills involved and more of a learning curve on how to execute any design.</p>
       <p>A website that exemplifies effective design would have to be https://www.zillow.com/?utm_content=1471764169|65545421228|aud-352785741564:kwd-570802407|509015461845|&semQue=null&k_clickid=_kenshoo_clickid_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7MGJBhD-ARIsAMZ0eeuf9CmsPVBEfLGxUp5GOZ55p1guJo7JytWZCRF9TUQ-RXmO5AXV4pMaAqG2EALw_wcB becuase the website is clean, simple, but effective in capturing your attention.</p>
       <p>A website that exemplifies effective communication is https://www.onepeloton.com/ becuase it is makes nagivating the site easy and you clearly unederstand the purpose and intention of the company.</p>
       <p>A website that works well is https://www.nytimes.com/ because although it does display a lot of information, it is clear how to nagivate and has a consistent look, design, and branding through all the pages.</p>
